# system-watcher
Repository for one of my old projects i did at a company.

The developement of this project was stopped because i don't like working with Windows and Powershell (and i got fired).
The install guide is in german for now since thats the original. Which had to be in german. Iam working on a translated guide but i wont promise any dates for it to be released.

This program was created to detect security issues in a Windows server domain (AD). It monitors which computers have been accessed by which users and uploading this to a MySQL Server. The PHP based web viewer for this seems to be lost. But if i find it ill add it here too. 

What you can do with these powershell scripts here ? Well ive made them in a way that they should be pretty easy to understand and use parts off the code.
